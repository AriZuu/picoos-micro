This library contains miscellaneous Pico]OS stuff that didn't have any better place to go.

Currently it contains:

*    FAT filesystem from [elm-chan.org][1]
*    microsecond spin-wait function
*    diagnostic functions about Pico]OS resource usage

For more info, see [this blog entry][2] or [manual][3].
